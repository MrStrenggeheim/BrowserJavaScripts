# BrowserJavaScripts

This Repo is just a compilation of all snippets of javascript that I find helpful while browsing.

## Recommended Usage
1. Create a Bookmarklet in your Browser.
2. Instead of a specific URL you put in one of the snippets you can find here.
3. Done. Click the bookmarklet to run the code.

## How it works
Every snippet is a standalone and self calling javascript function. By clicking on the bookmarklet the code inside this function will be run as if you typed it into the browser console.

## Contribute
Feel free to make any pull request to make this repo even more helpful.
